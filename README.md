1.OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 
The goal of embedded system challenge is to assemble a wearable speedometer which can calculate
velocity by estimating angular velocity accessible from our built-in gyroscope(L3GD20) - without a GPS. 
Our gyroscope can quantify 3-axis angular velocity. Decisively setting the sensor on the legs or feet to
calculate the distance travelled by the person and capturing the angular velocity and then converting the 
angular velocity into linear forward velocity. 
2.INTRODUCTION
Gyroscope sensor is a device that can measure and maintain the orientation and angular velocity of an 
object. These can measure the tilt and lateral orientation of the object whereas accelerometer can only 
measure the linear motion. Gyroscope sensors are also called as Angular Rate Sensor or Angular Velocity 
Sensors. These sensors are installed in the applications where the orientation of the object is difficult to 
sense by humans.
Gyroscopes are built into compasses on ships and aircraft, the steering mechanism in torpedoes, and the 
guidance systems installed in ballistic missiles and orbiting satellites among other places.
The principle of Gyroscope sensor can be understood by observing the working of Vibration Gyroscope 
sensor.
Gyroscope Sensors are used for versatile applications. Ring laser Gyros are used in Aircraft and Source 
shuttles whereas Fiber optic Gyros are used in racecars and motorboats.
The main functions of the Gyroscope Sensor for all the applications are Angular velocity sensing, angle 
sensing, and control mechanisms. Image blurring in cameras can be compensated by using Gyroscope 
Sensor-based optical image stabilization system.
 
3.OVERVIEW OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED
1) EMBEDDED C: Embedded C programming plays a key role to make the microcontroller run & 
perform the preferred actions. At present, we normally utilize several electronic devices like mobile 
phones, washing machines, security systems, refrigerators, digital cameras, etc. The controlling of these 
embedded devices can be done with the help of an embedded C program.
